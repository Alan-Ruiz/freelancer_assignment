Freelancer Assignment

A website with a filterable list of freelancers. A freelancer that comes to the website should be able to create a user account and a freelancer profile. The profile should consist of a short personal bio and an hourly rate in USD. The concept is similar to UpWork or Fiverr. People that are searching for freelancers should be able to see a page with all freelancers and filter them by their hourly rate

Ruby 3.0.3
Ruby on Rails 7
Hotwire - Turbo + Stimulus
TailwindCSS
esbuild
devise gem and pagy gem

You can SignUp in this website to create your own user. You also can create your own freelancer profile, where you can edit you BIO and RATE, once you
have a freelancer profile, you will be shown in the home page with all the rest of the freelancers, if you want to appear amongst the top of the list, you can make your profile featured, just click the button on your profile page.

There is a filter for the hourly rate of the freelancers for easier search in the home page.

You can run some tests on your teminal for the models typing "rspec"


Having more time I would like to implement more tests and make the pagination work with Hotwire so it only refreshes the list wrapper.
